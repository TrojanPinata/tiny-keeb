### a very small keyboard

<div align="left">

**What is it?**
- This is a 60% keyboard that is 50% smaller in every direction (25% of the area) from traditional keyboard.

**What are the specs?**
- It uses [B3F-1050](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/omron-electronics-inc-emc-div/B3F-1050/11889) switches and scaled down XDA keycaps on a custom PCB. The PCB linkes to a offboard Pi Pico which is running QMK.

**Why did I make this?**
- Small. No further questions.
